          The KOSEN-KMITL program focuses on engineering education, hands-on
          practice, and innovation to prepare students for real-world careers.

          KOSEN (National Institute of Technology) is a unique Japanese higher
          education system offering a five-year integrated program for training
          highly practical, hands-on engineers, starting right after junior high
          school (around age 15). These colleges focus on intense technical
          education, incorporating significant lab work, practical training, and
          research (like the famous Robocon) to produce skilled professionals
          for industry, often seen as the fastest route to becoming an advanced
          engineer.
